# Spring AI Example Application Validation

You are validating a Spring AI example application to determine if it ran successfully and demonstrated its intended functionality.

## Example Information
- **Name**: {example_name}
- **Type**: Spring AI Example Application
- **Components**: {components}

## Expected Behavior
{expected_behavior}

## README Context
{readme_excerpt}

## Application Log Output
```
{log_content}
```

## Validation Task

Please analyze the log output and determine if this Spring AI example application ran successfully and demonstrated its intended functionality.

Consider the following criteria:
1. **No Exceptions**: The application should not have thrown any unhandled exceptions
2. **Startup Success**: The application should have started properly (look for Spring Boot startup indicators)
3. **Functional Demonstration**: The application should have demonstrated the functionality described in the expected behavior
4. **Clean Termination**: If the application was designed to terminate, it should have done so cleanly

## Response Format

Respond with a JSON object in the following format:

```json
{{
  "success": true|false,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of the validation decision, including what evidence supports the pass/fail determination",
  "components_validated": ["list", "of", "components", "that", "were", "validated"],
  "functionality_demonstrated": [
    "List of functionality that was successfully demonstrated",
    "Based on the log output and expected behavior"
  ],
  "issues_found": [
    "List of any issues or problems found in the log output",
    "Empty array if no issues found"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "List of recommendations for improvement",
    "Empty array if no recommendations"
  ]
}}
```

Focus on whether the example successfully demonstrated Spring AI functionality as intended, not on code quality or optimization suggestions unless they directly impact the core functionality.
