# Spring AI Workflow Example Validation

You are validating a Spring AI workflow example that demonstrates multi-step AI processing pipelines.

## Example Information
- **Name**: {example_name}
- **Type**: Spring AI Workflow Example
- **Components**: {components}

## Expected Behavior
{expected_behavior}

## README Context
{readme_excerpt}

## Application Log Output
```
{log_content}
```

## Validation Task

Please analyze the log output and determine if this Spring AI workflow example successfully demonstrated multi-step AI processing.

**Workflow-Specific Validation Criteria:**
1. **Application Startup**: Spring Boot application started without errors
2. **Workflow Initialization**: Workflow components initialized properly
3. **Step Execution**: Each step in the workflow executed successfully
4. **Data Transformation**: Data was transformed correctly between steps
5. **Chain Completion**: The entire workflow chain completed successfully
6. **Output Generation**: Final output was generated in the expected format

**Key Indicators to Look For:**
- Step-by-step progress indicators in the logs
- Successful completion of each transformation phase
- Proper data flow between workflow steps
- Final output matching expected format (e.g., markdown table, JSON, etc.)
- No interruptions or failures in the workflow chain

**Expected Success Patterns:**
- Look for sequential step execution
- Validate that intermediate results are reasonable
- Check that final output is properly formatted
- Ensure workflow completed without timeouts or errors
