# Spring AI Client-Server Example Validation

You are validating a Spring AI example that involves client-server communication, typically Model Context Protocol (MCP) examples.

## Example Information
- **Name**: {example_name}
- **Type**: Spring AI Client-Server Example
- **Components**: {components}

## Expected Behavior
{expected_behavior}

## README Context
{readme_excerpt}

## Application Log Output
```
{log_content}
```

## Validation Task

Please analyze the log output and determine if this Spring AI client-server example successfully demonstrated distributed AI functionality.

**Client-Server Validation Criteria:**
1. **Server Startup**: Server component started and bound to port successfully
2. **Service Registration**: Required services/tools were registered properly
3. **Client Connection**: Client successfully connected to server
4. **Communication Protocol**: Proper protocol communication (MCP, HTTP, etc.)
5. **Tool/Service Invocation**: Client successfully invoked server tools/services
6. **Data Exchange**: Proper data exchange between client and server
7. **Response Handling**: Client properly handled server responses

**Key Indicators for MCP Examples:**
- Server initialization with tool registration
- Client connection establishment
- Tool invocation messages
- Successful data retrieval/processing
- Proper protocol message exchange

**Multi-Component Success Patterns:**
- Both server and client components should show successful operation
- Look for connection establishment messages
- Validate that requested operations completed successfully
- Check for proper error handling if any issues occurred

## Response Format

Respond with a JSON object:
