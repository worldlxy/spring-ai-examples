# Phase 2: Version Management System - Learnings

## Summary
Successfully created Spring AI version management scripts with backup/restore capabilities. All three scripts work as expected.

## Scripts Created
1. **update-spring-ai-version.sh** - Updates Spring AI version across all pom.xml files
2. **restore-spring-ai-version.sh** - Restores versions from backup
3. **check-spring-ai-version.sh** - Checks current version distribution

## Key Statistics
- Total pom.xml files: 34
- Files with spring-ai.version property: 17
- Files without version property: 17 (use BOM or hardcoded versions)

## Testing Results
### Version Update to 1.0.1
- ✅ Successfully updated all 17 files to 1.0.1
- ✅ Backup created automatically
- ✅ Integration test passed with 1.0.1

### Version Restore to 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT
- ✅ Successfully restored all 17 files from backup
- ✅ Integration test passed with 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT

## Issues Encountered and Resolved
1. **Check script including backup files**: Initially the check script was counting backup pom.xml files
   - **Fix**: Added `-not -path "./.version-backups/*"` to find command

## Version Compatibility
| Version | Test Result | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| 1.0.1 | ✅ PASSED | Published release version |
| 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT | ✅ PASSED | Current development version |

## Script Features
- **Validation**: Version format validation (X.Y.Z or X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT)
- **Backup**: Automatic timestamped backups before modifications
- **Verification**: Sample file check after update
- **Statistics**: Count of files updated and location of backups
- **Safety**: Non-destructive with easy restore capability

## Ready for Phase 3
- Version management system fully operational
- Both target versions tested and working
- Scripts are idempotent and safe to use in CI/CD
- Backup/restore provides rollback capability
