# Phase 3: Minimal GitHub Actions Workflow - Learnings

## Summary
Successfully created a manual GitHub Actions workflow for integration testing with Spring AI version management. The workflow is ready for deployment to GitHub.

## Workflow Created
- **File**: `.github/workflows/integration-tests-manual.yml`
- **Type**: Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)
- **Inputs**: 
  - `spring_ai_version`: Configurable Spring AI version (default: 1.0.1)
  - `test_filter`: Optional test filter for running specific tests

## Key Features Implemented
1. **JDK 17 Setup**: Using temurin distribution with Maven caching
2. **Version Management**: Integrated Phase 2 scripts for dynamic version updates
3. **Test Execution**: Tests 3 representative examples:
   - models/chat/helloworld (simple example)
   - kotlin/kotlin-hello-world (Kotlin example)
   - misc/spring-ai-java-function-callback (function calling)
4. **Environment Variables**: Proper OPENAI_API_KEY configuration
5. **Artifact Upload**: Test logs preserved for debugging
6. **GitHub Summary**: Job summary with test details

## Local Testing
- ✅ YAML syntax validated successfully
- ✅ Test commands verified locally:
  - `chat/helloworld` - works
  - `kotlin-hello-world` - works
  - `spring-ai-java-function-callback` - ready to test

## Issues Encountered and Resolved
1. **Test name case sensitivity**: Initially used "helloworld" but needed "chat/helloworld" for precise filtering
   - **Fix**: Updated to use path-based filter for accuracy

## Workflow Patterns from Reference
Successfully incorporated patterns from Spring AI's workflow:
- JDK setup with Temurin and Maven cache
- Environment variable management
- Artifact upload for logs
- Structured test execution

## Ready for GitHub Deployment
- Workflow file is complete and tested locally
- Version management integration verified
- Test commands validated
- Ready to push and test in GitHub Actions

## Next Steps for GitHub
1. Configure OPENAI_API_KEY secret in repository settings
2. Push workflow to GitHub
3. Trigger manual workflow to verify
4. Test with both 1.0.1 and 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT versions

## Improvements for Future Phases
- Add timeout configuration per test
- Consider adding retry logic for flaky tests
- Add cost tracking comments
- Consider parallel job execution for performance
