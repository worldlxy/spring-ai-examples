# Phase 1: Script Renaming - Learnings

## Summary
Successfully renamed `rit-direct.sh` to `run-integration-tests.sh` for better clarity and discoverability.

## Changes Made
1. Renamed script file: `integration-testing/scripts/rit-direct.sh` → `run-integration-tests.sh`
2. Updated all documentation references (7 files total):
   - `CLAUDE.md`
   - `integration-testing/README.md`
   - `integration-testing/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
   - Internal script comments
   - Log file naming pattern
   - Planning documents

## Testing Results
- ✅ Script executed successfully with `kotlin-hello-world` example
- ✅ Logs created in expected location: `integration-testing/logs/background-runs/`
- ✅ New log naming pattern: `run-integration-tests_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- ✅ Exit code 0 on successful test execution

## Issues Encountered
None - straightforward rename operation with no complications.

## Key Insights
1. The script was referenced in more places than initially expected (7 files)
2. Log file naming pattern embedded in the script itself needed updating
3. No references found in `integration-testing/TODO.txt`

## Ready for Phase 2
- Script is fully functional with new name
- All documentation updated
- Ready to proceed with version management implementation
