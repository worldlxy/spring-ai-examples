# TODO: Revisit Existing Integration Tests Workflow

## Context
There is a pre-existing GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml` that has been disabled.

## Location
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/blob/main/.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml

## Tasks to Complete
- [ ] Review the existing workflow structure and features
- [ ] Identify what can be migrated/merged from the old workflow
- [ ] Determine if both workflows should coexist or if they should be merged
- [ ] Consider the following aspects:
  - Trigger mechanisms (push, PR, schedule)
  - Test coverage scope
  - Performance optimizations
  - Caching strategies
  - Matrix strategies
  - Secret management

## Migration Considerations
- The new workflow uses the updated `run-integration-tests.sh` script
- The new workflow includes Spring AI version management
- The old workflow may have different test selection logic
- Check for any special environment configurations

## Decision Points
1. Keep both workflows with different purposes?
   - Old: Automated on push/PR
   - New: Manual with version control
   
2. Merge into single comprehensive workflow?
   - Combine triggers
   - Unify test selection
   - Consolidate configuration

3. Replace old with new entirely?
   - Migrate all features to new workflow
   - Archive old workflow

## Timeline
Review after Phase 5 (Automated Triggers) is complete, as that phase will add push/PR triggers to the new workflow.
