# GitHub Actions CI/CD Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement GitHub Actions integration testing with multi-version Spring AI support through a systematic, phased approach. All state is tracked via checkboxes in this plan and learnings documents.

**Priority Focus**: Version management (1.0.1 ↔ 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT) and multi-version test matrix validation are higher risk than full coverage, so we tackle these first.

## Reference Architecture
This plan leverages proven patterns from the Spring AI repository's GitHub Actions workflow (see `integration-testing/plans/spring-ai-github-build-workflow.yml`), including:
- JDK 17 setup with Temurin distribution and Maven caching
- Environment variable management for API keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SPRING_AI_OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Branch-based triggering (`main`, `*.*.x` pattern)
- Organization-specific conditions (`github.repository_owner`)
- Maven batch mode execution with update snapshots

Note: Our implementation will use simpler patterns suitable for examples repository (no Artifactory, docs deployment, or SSH keys).

## Goals (Reprioritized)
1. **Priority 1**: Version management scripts (1.0.1 ↔ 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT)
2. **Priority 2**: Multi-version test matrix validation with 3 examples
3. **Priority 3**: Full coverage rollout (97% local reliability gives confidence)
4. Enable automated integration testing via GitHub Actions
5. Provide manual and automatic workflow triggers
6. Create comprehensive documentation for maintenance

- [ ] Create maintenance runbook: `integration-testing/docs/CI_MAINTENANCE.md`
- [ ] Update main README.md with CI/CD section
- [ ] Document all workflow files
- [ ] Create secrets management guide
- [ ] Document rollback procedures

### Phase 9 Validation
- [ ] Run full manual workflow

## Key Principles

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with 3 examples, expand gradually
2. **Early Validation**: Test in GitHub Actions as soon as Phase 2
3. **Continuous Learning**: Each phase reads all previous learnings
4. **Adaptive Planning**: Adjust later phases based on discoveries
5. **State in Documents**: Track progress via checkboxes and learnings

## Success Metrics

- **Phase 2**: First GitHub Actions run with 3 examples ✓
- **Phase 4**: 8 examples running reliably ✓
- **Phase 5**: Automatic triggers working ✓
- **Phase 6**: Full 32 examples with 97% pass rate ✓
- **Phase 7**: Multi-version testing operational ✓
- **Phase 8**: Enhanced features implemented ✓
- **Phase 9**: Complete documentation ✓

## Risk Mitigation

1. **API Rate Limits**: Implement caching, limit concurrent runs
2. **Secret Leakage**: Use GitHub secrets, never commit keys
3. **Long Execution Times**: Optimize order, consider splitting jobs
4. **Flaky Tests**: Add retry logic, document known issues
5. **Version Conflicts**: Maintain compatibility matrix

## Maintenance Notes

- Review workflow runs weekly
- Update Spring AI versions monthly
- Archive old logs quarterly
- Review and update documentation semi-annually
- Monitor GitHub Actions usage and costs

## Future Enhancements (Not in Current Scope)

- Parallel execution with dynamic port assignment
- Test result trending dashboard
- Automatic issue creation for failures
- Integration with Spring AI release process
- Performance regression detection
