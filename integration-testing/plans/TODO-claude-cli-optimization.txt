# TODO: Optimize Claude Code CLI Integration in GitHub Actions

## Current Implementation
- Installing Claude Code CLI via npm: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- AI validator expects `claude` command to be available in PATH
- Uses ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable

## Potential Optimizations to Investigate

### 1. Use anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
- Official GitHub Action from Anthropic
- May not provide CLI in PATH (needs investigation)
- Could potentially modify AI validator to work with action directly

### 2. Create Custom GitHub Action
- Wrapper action that installs CLI and makes it available
- Could cache installation for performance

### 3. Modify AI Validator
- Update claude_code_wrapper.py to work with GitHub Action
- Or create alternate validation path for CI/CD

### 4. Performance Considerations
- npm global install may be slow
- Consider caching node_modules or npm cache
- Investigate if CLI can be installed locally vs globally

## Current Status
- Working solution with npm install
- AI validation enabled and functional
- Can optimize later without breaking changes

## Timeline
- Revisit after Phase 6 (Full Coverage) is complete
- Not blocking current progress
- Document any issues encountered during testing
